  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Beans and plantain is just my absolute fav. For me, as long as plantain are involved, I am in.</p>
    <p>It is a very simple dish to make. It just takes time for the beans to cook.</p>
    
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>

      <li>Onions</li>
      <li>Seasoning</li>
      <li>Crayfish</li>

   <ol>

      <li>When your beans is soft, sieve it out.</li>

      <li>Some people like their plantain fried, but I like mine boiled with the beans, so if you prefer it fried, you can fry the plantain and keep aside, but if like it boiled, add it to the beans and also add water.</li>
      <li>Allow to boil for 3 minutes, then add your onions and pepper.</li>
      <li>Allow to boil for 5 minutes, then add your seasoning and salt. Stir.</li>
